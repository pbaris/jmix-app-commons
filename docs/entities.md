## StandardEntity
<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->

A `@MappedSuperclass` that can serve as the base class for other entities, providing common fields and mappings.

It leverages Jmixâ€™s Has UUID Trait, Versioned Trait, and Audit Traits to provide the extended entity with UUID identification, versioning, and auditing capabilities.

???+ warning "Caution:"
    As a workaround for the known issue [MappedSuperclass is enhanced incorrectly if it has no Entity subclasses in the module](https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/317){: target="_blank" }, a class named StandardEntityWorkaround has been implemented. However, this class must not be used and exists solely as a temporary technical measure.

## Country
<!-- md:version 1.0.0 -->

An enum that provides all 249 countries, including their corresponding **ISO Alpha-2**, **ISO Alpha-3** and **ISO Numeric** codes for each country.

Can be used as a datatype in an entity and as a select field in the data views.

```java title="Entity"
@Column(name = "COUNTRY")
private String country;

public Country getCountry() {
    return country == null ? null : Country.fromId(country);
}

public void setCountry(final Country country) {
    this.country = country == null ? null : country.getId();
}
```

```xml title="Detail View"
<formLayout id="form" dataContainer="theDc">
    <select id="countryField" property="country"/>
</formLayout>
```
