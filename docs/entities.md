# Entities

## StandardEntity

`@since 1.0.0`

A `@MappedSuperclass` that can serve as the base class for other entities, providing common fields and mappings.

It leverages Jmixâ€™s Has UUID Trait, Versioned Trait, and Audit Traits to provide the extended entity with UUID identification, versioning, and auditing capabilities.

!!! warning "Caution:"
As a workaround for the known issue [MappedSuperclass is enhanced incorrectly if it has no Entity subclasses in the module](https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/317){: target="_blank" }, a class named StandardEntityWorkaround has been implemented. However, this class must not be used and exists solely as a temporary technical measure.
